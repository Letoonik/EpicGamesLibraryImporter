A tool that allows to import previously installed games, mostly useful when they disappeared from the library after a reinstall

At the moment, it's roughly functionnal.
1. Pick a folder and click Scan to search for Epic Game entries in all subfolders.
2. Click Import to add all found games to your EGL library.

When you open the Epic Game Launcher afterwards and go into your library, it will take a little while to scan, validate, and fix missing metadata for every game you just added.
